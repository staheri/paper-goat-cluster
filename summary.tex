We presented \goat, an analysis and testing framework for concurrent Go applications to assist concurrency debugging of real-world applications.
%
\goat combines static and dynamic methods to model and explores application execution.
%
The scheduler behavior is perturbed with automatically injected random delays to accelerate bug exposure if any.
%
By dynamic measurement of a set of coverage requirements, we quantify the quality of schedule-space exploration of \goat.
%
\goat detects all 68 blocking bugs of GoKer benchmark, which are the bug kernels of the top nine open-source projects written in Go.
%
The schedule perturbation showed effectiveness in accelerating the bug exposure.
%
Proposed coverage requirements accurately reflect the dynamic behavior of program executions and testing iterations.

The engineering of \goat is flexible and extensible to more advanced components.
%
For example, the current minimal \goat engine can be extended to take full control over the Go scheduler and ``guide'' testing towards untested interleaving.
%
We are dockerizing \goat for easy and public use, making it practical for production testing.
