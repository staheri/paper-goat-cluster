Go inherited traditional non-blocking bugs such as data races and atomicity violations from older concurrent languages while introducing new bug idioms due to its modern concepts.  The built-in race detector \cite{go-race-blog}, despite its limitations (\eg supporting up to 8192 goroutines), has proved to be effective in dynamically detecting data races in most cases quickly (more in section \ref{} *FIXME*).
