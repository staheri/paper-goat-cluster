For correctness of CSP-based concurrent languages like Go, Ng and Yoshida \cite{ng-dl-cc16} proposed a static tool to detect global deadlock in Go programs using choreography synthesis.
%
Later, Stadtmuller et al. \cite{stadtmuller-minigo-aplas16} proposed a static trace-based global detection approach based on forkable regular expressions.
%
Lange et al. proposed more static verification frameworks for checking channel safety, and liveness \cite{lange-fence-popl17}, and behavioral model checking \cite{lange-staticType-icse18}.
%
Both methods approximate Go programs with session types and behavioral contracts extracted from their SSA intermediate representation.
%
The mentioned work has limitations for handling dynamic (e.g., in-loop) goroutine or channel creation, and programs with many goroutines. Besides, the rate of generated false positives is high.
%
As dynamic (runtime-level) analysis approaches, Zhao et al. \cite{zhao-occam97} introduced a heuristic-based runtime monitoring approach for deadlock detection in Occam programs.
%
Sulzmann and Stadtmuller proposed a dynamic verification approach for synchronous (unbuffered) channels \cite{sulzmann-corr17}, and a vector-clock-based approach for asynchronous channels \cite{sulzmann-twophase-2018}.
%
Although they may support a larger subset of the Go language, they only focus on channels as the root cause of deadlocks and evaluated on relatively small examples.
%
Also, they usually do not scale for applications with thousands of goroutines and LOC \cite{dilley-empirical-saner19}.

%
Researchers have applied different systematic testing methods \cite{thomson-concurrencyTesting-ppopp14} to reduce the interleaving space to explore effectively and efficiently.
%
Delay-bounded \cite{emmi-delayBounded-popl11,burckhardt-depthBug-asplos10} and preemption-bounded \cite{madanlal-preemptionBound-pldi07} techniques systematically ``fuzz'' the scheduler to equally and fairly cover feasible interleaving.
%
Other tools like Maple \cite{yu-maple-oopsla12}, CalFuzzer \cite{joshi-calfuzzer},  and ConTest \cite{edelstein2003contest} \textit{actively} control the scheduler to maximize a pre-defined concurrency coverage criterion \cite{hong-syncTesting-issta12} or the probability of bug exposure \cite{burckhardt-depthBug-asplos10}.
