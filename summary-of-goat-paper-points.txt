Here, I'll summarize the GOAT Cluster paper to better rewrite it myself.

Points to make in various sections:

* Intro
  - start higher level
  - emphasize relevance to HPC and CLoud integration etc
  - emphasize 'simple is better'
    > delay-bounding is simple
    > can it work?
    > how well?
    > how well to eval?
      = today's bugs
        * bugs caught?
      = tomorrow's bugs
        * coverage goals?
        * coverage goals met?
