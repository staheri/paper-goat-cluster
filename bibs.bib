abstract="We describe a technique for verifying the control logic of pipelined microprocessors. It handles more complicated designs, and requires less human intervention, than existing methods. The technique automatically compares a pipelined implementation to an architectural description. The CPU time needed for verification is independent of the data path width, the register file size, and the number of ALU operations. Debugging information is automatically produced for incorrect processor designs. Much of the power of the method results from an efficient validity checker for a logic of uninterpreted functions with equality. Empirical results include the verification of a pipelined implementation of a subset of the DLX architecture.",

abstract = {Shared-memory multi-threaded programming is inherently more difficult than single-threaded programming. The main source of complexity is that, the threads of an application can interleave in so many different ways. To ensure correctness, a programmer has to test all possible thread interleavings, which, however, is impractical.Many rare thread interleavings remain untested in production systems, and they are the root cause for a majority of concurrency bugs. We propose a shared-memory multi-processor design that avoids untested interleavings to improve the correctness of a multi-threaded program. Since untested interleavings tend to occur infrequently at runtime, the performance cost of avoiding them is not high.We propose to encode the set of tested correct interleavings in a program's binary executable using Predecessor Set (PSet) constraints. These constraints are efficiently enforced at runtime using processor support, which ensures that the runtime follows a tested interleaving. We analyze several bugs in open source applications such as MySQL, Apache, Mozilla, etc., and show that, by enforcing PSet constraints, we can avoid not only data races and atomicity violations, but also other forms of concurrency bugs.},
